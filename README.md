# Urge China to introduce anti-abuse laws

_Even if you're not a big fan of animals, please consider supporting this cause as this affects society as a whole._

China's situation with animal welfare, especially for cats, is deeply troubling. China does not have good enough laws in place to prevent and punish animal abusers, this means abuse often goes unchecked. **This urgent issue demands immediate action.**

People are increasingly vocal and are currently demanding laws that offer genuine protection. The need for change has never been more critical, and it's crucial we rally together now to ensure animals are safeguarded.

## What's happening now?

A popular internet cat named **Mr. Fresh**, known for his appearances on a 24/7 livestream app "[Hello Street Cat](https://streetcat.wiki/)," became the target of a disturbing bounty. A group associated with animal abuse offered cryptocurrency for proof of Mr. Fresh's death.

These types of groups have already killed and abused **several other cats and kittens** that used to appear frequently on Hello Street Cat. Mr. Fresh has helped bring attention to this issue because of his popularity.

Cats on Hello Street Cat are not the only victims, there are and have been countless others that we don't even see.
